# Java Tetris

Hello!

I've just started learning java few weeks ago, so I decided to clone a simple game. I saw a few tutorials about making a Tetris game but they all seemed complex for my level, so I made this version more or less improvising on my own.

I come from web development background, so I tried to separate the code as much as possible. I surely learnt a lot making this project, hope it's useful for you too!

I hope to soon make a video tutorial on my youtube channel; https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCu9Jheh3oIsCdeqDmPEjzJA

You can write me there and subscribe if you want to get all the updates :)

I would like to do some improvements on the game. Maybe you can help me do it or suggest your own ideas, feel free to modify the code.

# TO DO LIST

Save high scores in local machine

Implement second player

Include calm and relaxing music

# Thanks for reading!
